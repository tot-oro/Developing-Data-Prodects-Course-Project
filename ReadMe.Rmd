This app utilizes the "movie" data set from "ggplot", which originally came from the iMDB database and contains data from 1893 to 2005. I have chosen 20 years data (1985 - 2004) to show the trends of movies that were released in each year by genre and MPAA ratings.

###Here is the [link](https://tot-oro.shinyapps.io/Developing-Data-Prodects-Course-Project) to the shinyapp. 
On the side bar, you could choose the years, genres, and MPAA ratings you're interested in. On the main panel, the number of movies released for each category would show in chronological order.
